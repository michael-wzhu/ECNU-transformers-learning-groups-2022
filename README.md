# ECNU transformers Reading List

This is an open knowledge discovery reading list maintained by THUIAR team. 

As real-world scenarios are usually open settings, it is crucial to discovery these open
knowledge (e.g., new user intents in dialogue system, image open set and so on) to improve the quality of machine learning systems. 

Our list is still incomplete and the taxonomy may be inappropriate. We will keep adding papers to improve the list, and welcome to **Pull Request** ! If you have any suggestions, please contact zhang-hl20@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn.
